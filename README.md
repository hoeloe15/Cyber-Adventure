# Cyber-Adventure

Hi all, this page contains an overview of all the resources I use and created during my Cyber Security Adventure. 

## Writeups for completed boxes

I have grouped the boxes by the month I have completed them in descending order.

### December
[Tryhackme - Basic Pentesting](https://github.com/hoeloe15/THM-BasicPentesting) - This box was the first box I have seen in a video from John Hammond where he solves it. I remember thinking this is so cool and I want to be able to do this. After finishing this one, I reach this stage in the adventure and curious to what is next. Overall I really like the box and really recommend it to others.

[Tryhackme - MrRobot](https://github.com/hoeloe15/THM-MrRobot) I really enjoyed working on this box! I love the television show MrRobot and this was super enjoyable due to the story that they took from that show and created a box for it. Again, really recommend this one, it's a great puzzle!
